#### **What is HTML?**
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the structure and content of a web page by using various elements and tags.

- HTML is **not a programming language**; it is a markup language.
- It defines the **structure** of web content.

#### **Key Characteristics**

1. **Standardized**: Follows rules defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
2. **Declarative**: Focuses on "what" content is rather than "how" it is displayed.
3. **Cross-platform**: Works on all modern web browsers.

#### **Basic Example**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Introduction to HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a basic example of an HTML document.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
